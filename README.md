Audio noise reduction for speech recognition applications

## Noise reduction algorithm
### Existing noise reduction models
#### Demucs model
[Demucs Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoiser) is Facebook's open source sound separation model. This is a speech enhancement model that runs in real time on a laptop computer with a CPU. The model is an Encoder-decoder architecture with Skip-Connection structure. Multiple loss functions are used to optimize both time domain and frequency domain. Experimental results show that this method can remove all kinds of background noise, including stationary noise and non-stationary noise, as well as indoor reverberation. It has high accuracy and effectiveness.

The structure is shown below
